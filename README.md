This is a collection of python scripts to work with the MIMS (Membrane Inlet 
Mass Spectrometer) developed by researchers at CSIRO and Southern Cross 
University.

The files contain code to run the MIMS system ("Field_Code"), code to 
postprocess/calibrate the raw data from the MIMS, code to interpret the results,
as well as some helper files.
